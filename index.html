    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Neutrals (Shades of stone, gray, with a soft teal accent). -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA features a prominent, full-width introductory section permanently visible at the top. The first part of this section is now split into two columns: the main introductory text on the left and a visual feature matrix/icon-based display for DFA benefits on the right. This enhances the initial presentation by integrating the visual directly with its context. The "Simplified Overview" is now presented visually as a series of connected circles, each representing a step, providing a clearer flow, and this section now spans the full width of the content area. Below this, the core two-column layout consists of a sticky navigation sidebar on the left listing the 8 DFA steps (labeled "DFA Template"), with reduced padding, and a main content area on the right displaying one step at a time, navigable via clicks or centered floating "Previous" and "Next" buttons. This structure balances persistent context, focused step-by-step exploration, and intuitive navigation. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
    - Report Info: Main introduction text & overall concept. -> Goal: Provide an engaging, always-present overview and visually represent benefits upfront. -> Presentation Method: Full-width section with detailed explanation on the left and a custom-designed visual matrix (not a chart) on the right within a flex container. -> Interaction: Static, serves as a persistent anchor. -> Justification: Integrates the core explanation with a visual summary of benefits directly, improving comprehension and initial engagement, offering a unique, non-chart visual style.
    - Report Info: DFA Benefits. -> Goal: Illustrate the importance and impact of each benefit. -> Presentation Method: A custom-designed visual matrix of icon-based cards, displayed side-by-side with the main introductory text within a responsive container. -> Interaction: Purely visual, no interactive data points. -> Justification: Provides a clear, digestible visual summary of key benefits using icons and direct text, moving away from conventional charts as requested.
    - Report Info: Simplified Overview of the Design First Approach. -> Goal: Present the process steps in an intuitive, flow-like manner with wider text descriptions and full-width layout. -> Presentation Method: A responsive series of connected circles with text, illustrating a clear flow for the process. Connectors adapt from vertical on small screens to horizontal on larger ones. The container itself now stretches full width. -> Interaction: Static, visual flow. -> Justification: Addresses the user's request for a "connected circles" visualization, creating a more dynamic and engaging representation of the workflow, and now occupies full available width for better visual impact and readability.
    - Report Info: The 8 steps of the "DFA - COAX way". -> Goal: Guide the user through the process. -> Presentation Method: A single, visible section in the main content area (initially 'Step 1'), with hidden sections for other steps, organized by a transparent sticky navigation bar with reduced padding. -> Interaction: Click-to-activate navigation in the sidebar, and centered "Previous/Next" floating buttons for linear progression. -> Justification: This transforms the guide into a focused, step-by-step experience, preventing information overload and enhancing navigation flow, while optimizing sidebar space.
    - Report Info: Example Mermaid syntax. -> Goal: Show the user what to write. -> Presentation Method: A styled HTML `<pre><code>` block. -> Justification: Directly presents the example code as text, which is what the source provides.
    - Report Info: C4 Diagram placeholder. -> Goal: Illustrate where diagrams would go. -> Presentation Method: Textual placeholder description. -> Justification: Provides context for a section that would typically contain complex visuals, without using actual SVG, Mermaid, or image files.
    - Library/Method: Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity, Tailwind CSS for styling. Chart.js is removed. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

            <div class="lg:w-1/2">
                <p>Design first approach in software development is a methodology that emphasizes the importance of designing a software system before writing any code. This involves creating a comprehensive plan that outlines the system's architecture, components, and interfaces. The goal of the design first approach is to create a well-thought-out system that meets the needs of the users and is easy to maintain and extend.</p>
                <p class="p-4 my-4">
                    There are several benefits to using a design first approach, including:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Reduced Rework:</strong> By carefully planning the system before writing any code, developers can avoid having to rework their code later on. This can save a significant amount of time and money.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Quality:</strong> A well-designed system is more likely to be high-quality and bug-free. This is because the design process forces developers to think through all of the possible scenarios and how the system should behave in each case.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Maintainability:</strong> A well-designed system is easier to maintain and extend. This is because the design documents provide a clear roadmap for how the system works and how it can be modified.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Communication:</strong> The design process helps to improve communication between different stakeholders, such as developers, product managers, and users. This is because everyone is working towards a common goal, which is to create a system that meets the needs of the users.</li>

        <p class="mt-4 w-full">The design first approach is often used in conjunction with other software development methodologies, such as agile development. In agile development, the design process is iterative and incremental, meaning that the design is updated as the system is developed. This allows the team to be flexible and respond to changes in requirements.</p>

                <p>This section defines the technical quality attributes of the system that are not covered by business requirements. These requirements ensure the system operates effectively. You only need to specify the ones relevant to the feature; the default assumption is that existing NFRs are not negatively impacted.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> How fast must the system respond?</li>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> What are the security constraints and requirements?</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> How should the system handle growth in users or data?</li>

                <p>A sequence diagram visually represents the interactions between different components or systems over time. It's an excellent tool for detailing the step-by-step logic of a process, such as an API call or a user interaction flow. Use Mermaid syntax to create as many diagrams as needed to describe all relevant flows.</p>
                <p class="mt-4">Example using Mermaid syntax:</p>
                <pre class="bg-stone-100 p-4 rounded-md mt-2 text-sm overflow-x-auto"><code class="language-mermaid">sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    Alice-)John: See you later!</code></pre>

                <p>This section provides a detailed, technical breakdown of the work required. List all the specific code units (classes, modules, functions, etc.) that need to be created or modified. The description should be clear enough for any developer to understand and implement the feature.</p>
                <p class="mt-4">For example:</p>
                <blockquote class="border-l-4 p-4 my-4">

                        <li>Update URLs</li>
                        <li>In `MagicLinks::PaymentsController`:
                            <ul class="list-circle pl-5 mt-2">
                                <li>Create page which generates payment link for the invoice</li>

                <p>If the feature involves architectural changes, use the C4 model to describe them. The C4 model helps visualize software architecture at different levels of detail (Context, Containers, Components, Code). Only create diagrams for the levels that are relevant to the feature. If there are no architectural changes, this section can be skipped.</p>
